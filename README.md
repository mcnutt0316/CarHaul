# CarHaul
Simple app to help me with work
This app is designed for truck drivers who haul cars, helping them optimize the placement of vehicles on their truck and trailer. By simply entering vehicle details, the app calculates the most efficient positioning of each car and estimates the weight distribution across the axles.

Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), this app ensures accurate, real-time feedback to help maintain balance and meet weight requirements, making each haul safer and more efficient.
